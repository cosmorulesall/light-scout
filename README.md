# light-scout
Tool to help photographers explore how light behaves at any location and time, using sun position, shadows, and urban geometry. It visualises direct sunlight and street orientation, then suggests suitable film stocks (colour, B&amp;W, and low-light) based on current lighting conditions, with clear, practical reasoning.
